# COVID NOW Project Idea

## Topic:
Our project will be about creating a health&fitness app with a device that allow users to utilise its function to both call and monitor the wearer of the device. The main use of this app and device will be focusing on the current world pandemic COVID-19. The device should be a wristband and the app should be available to both IOS and Android devices. It will be given out for those who got infected of the virus and for those remain self-quarantine at home with symptoms. The basic monitoring needs should be heart rate, blood pressure and body temperature. It can also be utilised with the elderly and those with illness or disabilities. The to drop in should be one way but an emergency drop in button will be added in case a call towards the user needs to be placed.

The app can be used in two different functions. Personal health and COVID-19. Personal health section will show what is being monitored in the device, heart rate, blood pressure and body temperature. Personal health section will allow the users to track up their health to keep them healthy. This personal health section can also be connected to COVID-19 section and it will allow the users to sent their daily health results to National Corona Virus Helpline or to a hospital that deals with COVID-19. But the main information will be focused on Australia’s current COVID-19 situation. It will have up-to-dated news and any reported case of new infected patients. This app will give every little details of COVID-19

## Motivation:
Not only Australians but people around the world are panicking and afraid of what is happening right now and that is also including our team member. People always want to know all the little things related to this situation, like how many people have been tested positive, died and cured. Also those people who have been contacted while they did not find out they were infected. Even though these details are quickly updated in the news, media and through people’s mouth, people are still slow and some might not even look up for news.

For the device, one of the major reasons people are travelling instead of locking down is to visit family or friends. With elderly people being most at risk of the virus, most travel would be directed towards them. The ability to drop in on those you hold near and dear that may not have the electronic understanding is vital and could help keep travelling to the minimum. The ability to monitor them from the comfort of an app will also minis the travel. This app will definitely fit in current IT trends as this is a big issue at the moment.

## Landscape:
There are already many existing apps out in the market about health&fitness. It can be tough to compete with other major brands but our the main function of our app is about current issue of COVID-19. The app will also deal about other pandemic virus that has happened in the past as well, this will differentiate us from the others. The app and the device will help to keep up the records patients body condition and it can be even sent out to specialists. Even after the virus becomes quiet, it can still be used as a health&fitness device for everyone, especially for elders.

## Aim:
Aim is to create an app and a device that can help for those in self-quarantine and for those people that are afraid of the current issue. Also to keep the community safe from COVID-19. It is to bring out most relevant news and about current situation as fast as possible and accurately. It will be created differently from different perspective by providing as many contents as possible both nationally and internationally to help stop the spread of COVID-19. App will be designed in a easy and convenient way so anyone from different age group can use.

First of all, the app is all about COVID-19 and the patients health checks. It is always so hard to get in touch with exact information about what is going on around this country and the world. People normally tend to get informations through media, younger people may get informations from Facebook or by mouth to mouth from their peers, so there are always some errors on the information, fake news and vides. The app will have all the information about COVID-19, it will be handy as because rather then searching up news from google and Facebook it will show everything in one click in the app. The informations will be accurate as it will based on Australia Government Department of Health.

## Plans and Progress
This project began to just give some accurate informations about COVID-19 effectively but as we were developing what contents to add for the app, COVID-19 was too limited and later on, it would be challenging for us to keep the app running so to make this app last longer from the users, we decided to add more function other than COVID-19. First we came up with personal health by having all the functions related to health&fitness such as trackers, heart rates, body temeprature, blood pressure and daily food intake as being healthy and fit in our life is a trend these days. Secondly, we added more idea by creating a matching device that can be connected to the app with bluetooth.

To make this project become active, there are some skills required
- Designing the app, the appearance is important as users want it to be attractive as well as
delivering a smooth experience and value.
- product management, get to know the client’s vision behind the app.
- Communication, between the team. Inventor, design, product managing.
- Cross- Platform, Android, iOS, or Windows
- Data Collected and Market research, Date will show how the app is recognised and will show
the end-results.
- Coding, such as HTML5, Java, C++, Objective-C, Swift and C#.
- Security, Users private information must be secured. and to as the app is data based, it has to
make sure no one can heck the app and change the date.
- Marketing, to let people know that this kind app exist in the market

## Contents for the app
**Current status**
- Current situation and case number In Australia and Current situation and case number across
the world showing graphs and number of those got infected, death and cured.
- Official Government response and alerts to the COVID-19 outbreak
- A Map showing locations where confirmed cases of COVID-19 has happened with time and
date(information based on Australian Government Health Alert)

**Information about COVID-19**
- Latest News and Media(videos) related to COVID-19 for Australia and Worldwide
- Resources( A list of resources in English about COVID-19, including fact sheets, guidelines and
other publications, there will a link connected to Department of health page so users can
download easily into their phones and tablet PCs
- Frequently asked question about COVID-19
- Symptoms(List of symptoms listed form early stage of the virus.
- How to protect guide(List of to do list to prevent from catching the virus)
- List of hospitals and clinics where concerned users with symptoms can get tested with specific
details(name of the hospital/address)
- Conversation section where users can write about their concerns and opinion about the
situations
- Users can share information about where and what time users can get essential supplies(If the
users set their location it will show the nearest supermarket)
- Phone number of National Corona Virus Helpline
- Information about past world pandemic disease to let people be aware
- It will give alerts for new cases that have been founded, for example “Myer Castle Hill has
closed immediately after it was confirmed an employee had contracted COVID-19”
“ Total number of confirmed case of COVID-19 reached up to 1000 in Australia”
If the users click this alert it will direct them to the page about the news.

**Personal Health Checks**
- monitor body temperature, blood pressure and heart rate.
- Daily, weekly and monthly data will be stored and graphed.
- Overall monitoring and real-life data but by using this data, the app and device can calibrate to
ensure that real data is used instead of estimates.
- When real data is used the accuracy of alerts and monitoring also increases.

Health monitoring is the one of the major feature for the device. The desired aspects it would
monitor are body temperature, blood pressure and heart rate. These are the easiest and most
feasible of the human "vitals" to monitor in a device this size. These vitals are also very simplistic
monitors of health. The app will be essential to the project and will be used by those monitoring.
As this device is being used to monitor, it will be of great use if a feature of the app was a tracker.

**The device**
- Will have ability to “drop in” which is pared with the feature of real time GPS.
- When logged into the app, the device will feed the wearers geographical location to the app.
- The geographical location feature also plays a crucial part if anything were to go wrong with the
wearer
- When the emergency drop in button is used on the wearer's device, the device will attempt to
contact 3 saved contacts within the database.
- Whoever picks up first will have the option to call the emergency number of whatever country
the wearer is in. This is why it is imperative to have geographical location on the device.
- The last feature will be the ability to share results and data recorded on the app.The recored
data can be sent straight away to clinics and hospitals near by the of the wearers place using
real time GPS.

## Outcome
If the project is successful, it would greatly impact those who care for the elderly, and those with an illness during self-quarantine. Even though this project is focused on COVID-19, people can still use the device as their health tracker and later on when COVID-19 become quiet in our society, the app can contain other health alerts and tips and other health related informations.

## Roles

### Management
Project Manager/Team Leader

Role would be utilised to set a goal for the team with achievable and measureable targets. Sets standards and follows up with the team memebers to ensure the goal is achieved which in this case is the development & deployment of the COVID-19 app. Once deployed, utilise market trends/demand to feed back through to the team & allow changes to be made to the app.

### Design
Graphic design/Coding

Responsable for the look. From start to finish, drawing up app structure and user interface & ensuring it's user friendly to appeal to a larger market. The team would be respsonsible for the development of the app and bringing the design to life. Once deployed, this team would also be responsable for managing updates, fixing bugs and implementing change.

### Media/content
Content editors/social media team

Monitoring repitable news sources to ensure the information on the app is current and accurate. Utilising social media to reach a diverse range of people would be key. The primary role of this team would essentially be to ensure the information we're providing is factual. Ensuring these sources are available for users to click a link to view further information if need be.

### Marketing
Advertising/monitor market trends - demands app functionality

Controlling advertising and ensuring people are aware this app exists. Develop relationships with key stakeholders is paramount to ensure the success of the app. Having strong communication to medical professionals, news outlets & market analysis professionals to ensure the app is current with demand and funtionality.

## Scope

### Current Status:
This service would show the notable status' from around the world. New cases, deaths, recoveries for Australia as well as for the world. This would also display on a state level a map of confirmed COVID cases demonstrating hot spots.

### Latest/important Information:
This would display current news and media with links available for users to visit the source. In addition to news, a list of resources & fact sheets would be available to the user. A symptom checker with locations of closest COVID testing clinics. Updated FAQ would be displayed here as well.

### Personal Health Checklist:
Intergration with wearable technology to enable the user to monitor and track daily health figures - heart rate, blood pressure, temperate. The user can then consent to this information being used on the app to display real life data to other users and not just estimates.

### Drop-in GPS Feature:
While connected this feature allows the app to track a user & can play a cruical part if something were to go wrong. The user has the ability to add emergency contacts via the app and they will be contacted when the device is activated.

### Relevant Information:
This will store past news articles, a guide on how to protect yourself when going out, early stage symptoms & notable medical facilites around (not just COVID clinics). Relevant important numbers for example the COVID helpline.

### Forum system:
For users to post updates of themselves, specials on much needed items in the area as well as available items (tp, sani etc).  The forum system can also be used for users to share tips & tricks of surviving isolation.

## Limits

### Single Sign in/Socials loging:
Currently there is no intergration with social media accounts. Although platforms could be used for marketing and communication there is no feature currently to allow this intergration.

### Notifications of infected peron:
No functionality is currently available to notify users if they've been in close range of someone who is infected, alternate option is to refer to the hotspot map in their local area.

### General Advice:
Advice related to COVID-19 only is displayed on this app. No further information regarding job seeking, mental health advice, self-isolation techniques or business support.

## Tools and Technologies.
There is an extremely wide range of tools and technologies required for this project. To start with, you need app development tools for each platform. For android, you will likely use Android Studio combined with the Java language. For IOS, you would use Xcode combined with the Swift programming language.

Hardware technologies such as arduino would also be needed to create the hardware piece that would connect to the program.

Miscellaneous software technologies such as database and cybersecurity based technologies will definitely be needed to make sure the app and it's data is kept secure.

## Testing
Testing of the app part of the project would start when there is some sort of functional ability to it. The focus would be on the development and testing of the hardware side. Making sure that the hardware can stand up to regular use, be easy enough for a regular person to use, make sure its connection functionality to the app works correctly are all significant challenges which would need to be ironed out. Having users test the hardware, and eventually the software as well would be very important to make sure it is universally usable. Wre would need users from almost every background to make sure that you don't need specialised knowledge. To do this, we would likely set up spots in large public areas such as shopping centres, asking people to come and try our device and app.

## Timeframe
- Week 1-6:
Week 1	Rashad worked on the team profile within the first two weeks as Min tackled the Overview, Matthew tackled tools and technologies and Hayden tackled the team roles. Within the next 3 weeks Rashad tackled the career plans the time frame and the risks as min tackled the aims as well as the plan and progress, Hayden tackled the scope and limitations and Matthew tackled the testing. The final week was spent with the group compiling the information, making final adjustments and completing the group reflection.

- Week 7:
The first extended week would have us repeating the team website and really delving deeper into the html coding and ensuring presentation is at it’s finest.

- Week 8:
The next week would include the adaptation of the individual websites and look into discussing at a deeper level the project description overview.

- Week 9:
By now we would have time to really further our plans and progress and as a good time to check in we would be able to iron out any kinks in our plans. This would allow us to utilize and maximise the remaining time.

- Week 10:
By now if there are any problems with roles they would be noticeable and we can switch them around to better suit our skillset.

- Week 11-13:
Testing is key and to do that we need to finalise or at least come close to a final design. The next 3 weeks will be used to finalise the design and project. With any remaining time, we will revisit and explore the skills and jobs portion of the assessment.

- Week 14:
Week 14 would be a good time to revise everything. Proof reading and editing to finalise the copy.

- Week 15:
The final weeks will be a good time to give a detailed group reflection. In doing so now, we still have room to improve with the final week and we are able to really discuss what could have gone better and what didn’t.

- Week 16:
This final week will be used to fix any last remaining tasks or mistakes. The final product in terms of design and information wise will be of the highest standard possible through this final check.

## Risks
There are many risks involved with creating the product at hand. If concentrating on non-generic risks and we choose to delve into the program and hardware specific risks, we can shorten the long list. In terms of the program risks, they are as follows:
- The program used to create the app may not be as easy as the instructional makes it out to be
-	The program may require further programming knowledge that we may have to acquire
-	The app’s features may take the use of other software we have not looked at yet
-	The apps production and constant updating may be unreasonable financially
-	The app may require an assistance or support line to deal with issues
-	If the program used is not clear or “cuts corners”, the app may be low in quality leading to bugs and further problems down the line
-	The application must find a balance between functionality, design and ease of access for the user.

In terms of hardware risks, they are as follows:
-	The product may come out cheap in quality
-	Creating a mass number of units is a financial risk if sales are prospected too highly
-	The use of similar hardware to models that are currently on the market may lead to legal action being taken against the product
-	The possibility of products being produced internationally as opposed to internally may cause popularity and sales to drop
-	The hardware may lead to slow performance if cost is a dominant factor

## Group processes and communications
Communication is vital in any team and the difference between a team in sync through communication and a team working as autonomous members is night and day. Within our group it has been established that WhatsApp is our main method of communication. If need be Gmail can be used to send files and the use of GitHub for file sharing to multiple persons. The use of WhatsApp allows the group to touch base at least once every two days. A simple message once every two days can ensure we are effectively working towards deadlines and can act as a reminder if tasks need to be completed or if help is needed on certain tasks. The use of WhatsApp allows for video calling which replaces the need for face to face interaction and makes communicating a breeze. In terms of meeting at least 2 a week is justifiable and necessary. In these meetings we will tackle the bigger issues, work to create deadlines, progress check and plan ahead.
