### Media/content
Content editors/social media team

Monitoring repitable news sources to ensure the information on the app is current and accurate. Utilising social media to reach a diverse range of people would be key.

## Scope

### Current Status:
This service would show the notable status' from around the world. New cases, deaths, recoveries for Australia as well as for the world. This would also display on a state level a map of confirmed COVID cases demonstrating hot spots.

### Latest/important Information:
This would display current news and media with links available for users to visit the source. In addition to news, a list of resources & fact sheets would be available to the user. A symptom checker with locations of closest COVID testing clinics. Updated FAQ would be displayed here as well.

### Personal Health Checklist:
Intergration with wearable technology to enable the user to monitor and track daily health figures - heart rate, blood pressure, temperate. The user can then consent to this information being used on the app to display real life data to other users and not just estimates.

### Drop-in GPS Feature:
While connected this feature allows the app to track a user & can play a cruical part if something were to go wrong. The user has the ability to add emergency contacts via the app and they will be contacted when the device is activated.

### Relevant Information:
This will store past news articles, a guide on how to protect yourself when going out, early stage symptoms & notable medical facilites around (not just COVID clinics). Relevant important numbers for example the COVID helpline.

### Forum system:
For users to post updates of themselves, specials on much needed items in the area as well as available items (tp, sani etc).  The forum system can also be used for users to share tips & tricks of surviving isolation.

## Limits

### Single Sign in/Socials loging:
Currently there is no intergration with social media accounts. Although platforms could be used for marketing and communication there is no feature currently to allow this intergration.

### Notifications of infected peron:
No functionality is currently available to notify users if they've been in close range of someone who is infected, alternate option is to refer to the hotspot map in their local area.

### General Advice:
Advice related to COVID-19 only is displayed on this app. No further information regarding job seeking, mental health advice, self-isolation techniques or business support.

## Tools and Technologies.
There is an extremely wide range of tools and technologies required for this project. To start with, you need app development tools for each platform. For android, you will likely use Android Studio combined with the Java language.
