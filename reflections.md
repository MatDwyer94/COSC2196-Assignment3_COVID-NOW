**What went well?**
The group works extremely well together. Our abilities all work well together and we all contribute to the team in different ways. So in terms of team work, that really worked well for us. The group also is able to learn and progress as a whole. It never felt like one person was behind, we all seem to move and function as gears in a much bigger machine.

**What could be improved?**
The time management and planning definitely improved but it is something we definitely could still work on. This was an issue for us in the first group assignment and although it majorly improved it definitely is something that if worked on, would boost our productivity and the quality we put out.

**At least one thing that was surprising?**
The group was able to mesh well the second time round. It was almost as if the momentum gained in assessment 1 was not lost and we worked fluently. This almost just seemed like an extension instead of a separate assessment.

**At least one thing that you have learned about groups?**
It really is okay to be dependant on one another. As long as you stay in contact and are willing to help and learn, being dependant is by no means a bad thing. It allows members to grow as a whole and really allows for the people in the group to focus and lock down which ultimately produces an extremely high quality of work.

**What went well?**
We had a specific idea about our project so it was quite easy to find information about our project idea. Our group did well in dividing the each other parts and everyone was satisfied in the mount of work they had to do.

**What could be improved?**
Because this is a group assignment and it is done online, it was quite hard to meet up and have conversation about the assignment as everyone has their own lifestyle. It would be better to choose a specific date and time to meet up for discussing assignment.

**At Least one thing that was surprising**
I was surprised how everyone knew what they were doing, they understood their part well and coped well in each others part well.

**At least one thing that you have learned about groups**
During this group work, i learnt communication and time managing is very important. Having a exact opinion will be better as this assignment can only be done online.

My Github activity wasn’t very active. To be honest I am not very familiar using Github and I haven’t quite understand how to run the site well but other members from the group used Github to upload the files and by looking at that members Github it sort so got me on track on how to use it.
