s3851521

I am a 20-year-old student studying information technology as a bridge into software engineering. I was born in Harare, Zimbabwe but moved to Australia when I was 4. Besides English I speak some Shona (The national language of Zimbabwe) and I am currently learning Korean. I started my schooling in 2005 at Algester Primary School and finished my Primary schooling there in 2011. I then moved to Stretton State College where I completed my senior schooling in 2016. After successfully completing my senior schooling I decided to further myself in multiple bachelors before deciding on Information Technology. I studied Engineering at Griffith University, Exercise Science at Australian Catholic University and Business at Griffith University. I have a huge passion for basketball which was the reason for choosing exercise science and a huge love of technology which majorly influenced my decision to do engineering and information technology.

s3755242

I was born and raised half of my life in a little island called Jeju in South Korea, When I turned 12 my family decided to move to Australia. My parents wanted me to experience and learn different stuff outside of Korea as Korean education is pretty harsh. Then I went to girls high school in Sydney. Being friends with people with different nationality taught me a lot in many ways. I don’t really have a hobby, but I like to going to art galleries to see the exhibitions. I like finding out old and new artists around the world, and experience different types of art forms and learn some histories and cultures from the artists and the art work. I also like to visit the gallery shops and buys some goods that are related to the exhibition. My Interest in IT at the moment is web designing and cyber security. This is because nowadays our society is more focused and lean on media. Due to that media will develop rapidly so I think web developing and designing and cyber security will become more essential. At the moment I don’t have any IT experience but I would like to experience various field in IT.

## Ideal Jobs

### Hayden

My dream or ideal job: href='https://www.seek.com.au/job/41153311?type=standard#searchRequestToken=2e65d6c4-5fad-4098-914b-d47849b89144'> Network Administrator

**Description of Position**

The role of a network administrator makes you responsible for maintenance of a specific
computer network as well as solving any problems that occur with them. This appeals to
me because I enjoy being hands on as well as helping people. Being on the ground
essentially & trouble shooting makes it appealing as every day could be different
administrator and filled with different challenges.

**Skills and Qualifications required**

Qualifications for this role generally require a degree in network administration as well as
systems administration training. Effective communication skills are key as well as the
ability to demonstrate effective problem solving.

**Current Skills and Qualifications**

I currently have a basic understanding of the following:
- Setting up a network with multiple PCs, enabling sharing, printing etc
- Ability to troubleshoot a number of networking issues

**Plan to attain Skills and Qualifications**

I hope to obtain the relevant skills required for this position throughout the course of this
course. Ideally, after the basics are learnt I would like to tailor my courses toward this
position, ideally focusing on networking/cloud subjects to assist in growing my knowledge
and exposure.

### Rashad

**A description of the position**

The position calls for a software engineer. A software engineer deals with the crafting,
designing and development of software. Once it is developed, they look after testing,
evaluating and maintaining the software. This position is extremely appealing to me as I
am a very creative person who like puzzles. As each problem is similar to a puzzle, I look
to find the best solution of coding to perfectly fix the problem. The position is one that
requires a lot of patience and resilience which are two of my strongest characteristics.

**Skills and qualifications required**

The skills needed include the ability to code in multiple forms of coding. To get this high
level of coding skill I will need to complete a degree in information technology. By
completing the degree, I will learn the programming basics and advanced skills in all the
types of code mentioned in the job description. The skill to work cohesively in a team of
programmers is a necessity. The job description also implies that the person that fills this
role would need to have an outgoing personality as they are willing to help the successful
candidate build up their knowledge and fulfill personal goals in relations to programming.

**Current skills and qualifications**

Although I do have the ability to work cohesively in any team I am put into, I am
unfortunately lacking the practical skills and knowledge of coding. I am very outgoing and
find the idea of the employer being so open to supporting the successful candidate in their
pursuit of personal development extremely attractive. I have the ability to think outside
the box which will benefit me in creating each solution. I also possess a keen eye for
detail which will make the designing and development process of creating the software a
lot easier.

**Plan to attain Skills and Qualifications**

The required skills in coding are only obtainable by university study. A qualification in
Information technology will help me bridge into software engineering, where I can gain an
understanding on each type of coding and how to put it into practice. To be placed into a
role like this some experience in utilising university knowledge into practical use is
necessary. To gain the necessary experience, I hope to hold an entry level position in a
similar role.

![Job Advertisement](/jobListing.png)

**Description of Position**

An engineer that helps create and implement automation systems using various different
technologies. I have always loved the idea of automation and making technology do the
work for you so this would be an incredibly interesting job.

**Skills and Qualifications required**

Knowledge in an extremely wide variety of progamming and coding languages would be
essential as well as how they interact with different frameworks. Even how the
frameworks work together. It would also be extremely helpful to know how electronics
work to be able to more efficiently create code for it. Qualifications in IT and possibly
electrical engineering would be necessary/advantageous to be successful at a job like this.

**Current Skills and Qualifications**

I currently have basic programming skills and electronics knowledge. But still not on the
level needed for a job of this level.

**Plan to attain Skills and Qualifications**

Study a bachelor of IT with a focus on programming, internet and connected technologies,
and cybersecurity. I could possibly pursue post graduate studies in electrical engineering
to help solidify knowledge in more related areas.

provide swift and precise solutions to identify and protect their systems against enemy
hackers.

**Current Skills and Qualifications**

At the moment I have intermediate skills in IT because I just started to learn this degree.

**Plan to attain Skills and Qualifications**

Even though it says they do all the training without any qualification required in IT degree,
I think some basic knowledge of IT is required in order to follow up the training they are
providing.

### Summary

Within the Group there is a split down the middle. Matthew and Rashad look to further
their studies to develop skills in programming and both hope to utilise this in their role.
Min and Hayden look to further their studies to follow analytics and net development
which include similar features. The steps and procedures to get to the engineering roles
that Matthew and Rashad are very similar and include similar qualifications. Min and
Hayden’s Qualifications do differ as they are in separate streams of Information
technology. Even if there are similarities at the core of their roles, different
specialisations will be needed. In terms of time frames to achieve the ideal job there is a
general similarity in time frame with the groups average timeframe to achieve the ideal
job being approximately 5 years with the maximum and minimum time frame alleviating
approximately 1 year from that
